# ðŸ“š Teaching Methods Research: Traditional vs Visual (Manim-based) Techniques

This repository was created as part of an academic research project comparing **traditional chalk-and-board teaching methods** with **visual teaching techniques** using the **Manim** animation engine. The project aims to evaluate how visualizations, especially those developed using Python-based animation libraries, can impact studentsâ€™ understanding, engagement, and retentionâ€”specifically in technical subjects like deep learning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This research is focused on:
- Evaluating the effectiveness of **Manim-based visual teaching** compared to traditional methods.
- Conducting student surveys and statistical hypothesis tests on understanding, engagement, and recall.
- Generating animated educational content using Manim for specific topics.
- Measuring learning outcomes through structured experiments.

## ðŸ§  What is Manim?

**Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine)** is an open-source Python library for creating precise, programmatically-generated mathematical animations. It allows educators and researchers to visually represent complex mathematical and computational ideas with clarity.

Manim was originally created by **Grant Sanderson**, the creator of the popular YouTube channel **[3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)**, which is renowned for its beautifully animated explanations of math concepts.
